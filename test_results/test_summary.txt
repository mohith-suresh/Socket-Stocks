# Stock Trading System Test Summary

## Test Results

| Test Name | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Authentication Test | ✅ PASS | Users can authenticate with correct credentials |
| Invalid Authentication Test | ✅ PASS | Invalid credentials are properly rejected |
| Quote (All Stocks) | ✅ PASS | System correctly returns all stock information |
| Quote (Specific Stock) | ✅ PASS | System correctly returns specific stock information |
| Position/Portfolio | ✅ PASS | User portfolio information is correctly retrieved and displayed |
| Buy (Transaction) | ✅ PASS | Buy transactions complete successfully with confirmation |
| Sell (Transaction) | ✅ PASS | Sell transactions complete successfully with confirmation |

## System Status

All four server components are running correctly and communicating with each other:
- Server M (TCP port 45000, UDP port 44000): Working as expected
- Server A (UDP port 41000): Authentication working correctly
- Server P (UDP port 42000): Portfolio management and transactions working correctly
- Server Q (UDP port 43000): Stock quotes and price adjustments working correctly

## Beej's Guide Compliance

All server components have been updated to strictly adhere to Beej's Guide to Network Programming:
- ✅ Proper socket initialization and cleanup
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Signal handling with sigaction()
- ✅ Proper send/receive with null termination
- ✅ Timeout configuration
- ✅ Resource management
- ✅ Message formatting with consistent null termination

## Key Fixes Implemented

1. Fixed null termination in all message exchanges to ensure reliable communication
2. Added robust handling of partial sends and receives
3. Enhanced error handling in all network operations
4. Improved memory management to prevent leaks
5. Added detailed logging for easier debugging
6. Enhanced error handling for invalid commands
7. Fixed timeout handling in socket communications
8. Improved buy/sell/position functionality with proper null termination
9. Fixed comprehensive test script to properly validate all test cases
10. Added multiple client support using fork() in Server M for concurrent connections
11. Fixed "insufficient shares" error message with proper null termination

## Conclusion

The system is now fully functional with all components working correctly. All test cases pass successfully, and the core functionality of authentication, quote retrieval, portfolio management, and buy/sell transactions operate as expected. The system supports multiple client connections simultaneously through the use of the fork() system call, allowing the server to handle concurrent client sessions. Error handling is robust, including proper handling of insufficient shares during selling operations with appropriate error messages. The implementation strictly adheres to Beej's Guide to Network Programming standards and best practices.
