# Beej's Guide to Network Programming Compliance Report

## Verified Socket Programming Practices

1. **Error Handling**
   - All socket creation calls now check for failures and report detailed error messages
   - Error conditions include proper cleanup of resources before exiting
   - Network functions properly check for EINTR (interrupted system calls)
   - Socket options are verified and non-fatal issues are logged as warnings

2. **Socket Option Configuration**
   - SO_REUSEADDR implemented to allow quick socket rebinding after server restart
   - Socket timeouts now configured uniformly across all servers
   - Consistent timeout values between TCP and UDP sockets

3. **Memory Management**
   - All buffer operations implement proper bounds checking 
   - Data buffers are properly null-terminated after receive operations
   - No buffer overflows possible in string handling routines

4. **Address Structure Handling**
   - Consistent use of memset() to zero out socket address structures
   - Proper network-to-host byte order conversions for all values
   - Correctly binding to INADDR_ANY for better connectivity

5. **Robust Data Transmission**
   - Implementation of send_with_retry() wrapper to handle partial sends
   - Implementation of recv_with_retry() wrapper to handle partial receives
   - Both wrappers handle interruption (EINTR) and would-block conditions

6. **Signal Handling**
   - SIGINT handlers use sigaction() instead of signal() for better portability
   - Signal handlers are properly registered early in execution
   - Graceful cleanup of all resources on termination

## Authentication System Compliance
The authentication system now follows Beej's recommended pattern for client-server communication:
1. Client connects to server using proper TCP socket connection
2. Client sends authentication credentials using robust send wrapper
3. Server validates credentials with the Auth Server using proper UDP communication
4. Server responds with success/failure using robust send wrapper
5. Client processes response using robust receive wrapper

## TCP/UDP Implementation Compliance
- TCP connections properly implement the socket-bind-listen-accept pattern
- UDP communications follow the socket-bind-sendto/recvfrom pattern
- Error checking at each step follows Beej's recommended practices

## Code Readability and Structure
- Consistent error messages format following Beej's examples
- Proper comments explaining purpose of socket programming operations
- Explicit handling of corner cases

## Performance Considerations
- Non-blocking socket option support is available but commented out as it would require major code changes
- Timeout configuration provides responsive behavior while preventing hangs
- Proper cleanup of all resources even in error conditions
